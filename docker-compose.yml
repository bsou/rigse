# In this file the web app and solr ports are not published. However, if you run
# `docker-compose up` (without customizing your environment) the ports will be published
# to 3000 and 8983.  This is because the docker-compose.override.yml file will be loaded
# automatically by docker-compose.
# You will likely want to modify how the ports are published, so they don't conflict.
# Take a look at the this overlay for more information:
#   docker/dev/docker-compose-random-ports.yml
