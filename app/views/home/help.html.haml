In addition to this information the students will be asked to answer three security questions.  The security questions allow the student to reset the password to their account if they can not remember their password. It is important that they answer all three questions because as a teacher you can not access their password or reset their password for them.

            If you do not want to completely create your own activity you can customize your class activities by editing one of the exemplar activities that has already been created. Just follow the next set of directions.

                To customize an activity, or make your own version of the activity for your class, first find the activity you want to customize from the list of activities.  In the buttons next to the activity there should be a button that looks like two stacked pieces of paper. By clicking on that button you will be able to make your own version of the activity.

                Before you save your activity think about if you only want to be able to use the activity or if you want to share it with the Innovative Technology in Science Inquiry community. Under the name of your activity you can set the “publication status.” If you want to keep the activity to yourself you can select private. If you want to share the activity you can set the “publication status” to public.

                To save your activity you must have saved all the open WYSIWYG boxes. If you have not saved all the WYSIWYG boxes the top
