Current Changes to move to rails 3.2

- using formats option for the ot_interface_manager call in otml_helper, also in spec/views/activities/_show.otml.haml_spec.rb
- gem updates
- deep_cloning fixes
- rspec "theme unimplemented" extension fix
- remove rack_hotfix that it not needed anymore
- change RoleRequirementsSystem to work on Rails 3.2 (this looks like it isn't really used anyway)
- change Clonable to use dup instead of clone
- update features/support/env.rb
- switch cucumber steps to use "step" method instead of When, Then, or Given
- handle strange capybara return from popup dialogs
- modified test for a valid active record connection
- remove debug_rjs (not supported in rails 3.2)
- use flash.each instead of each_pair

Some of these can probabably be pulled back into rails 3.0 to reduce the differences, here are my current candidates for this:
- using formats option for the ot_interface_manager call in otml_helper, also in spec/views/activities/_show.otml.haml_spec.rb
- handle strange capybara return from popup dialogs
- use flash.each instead of each_pair

Others might be simplied by coming up with a way that works in rails 3.0 and rails 3.2:
- change RoleRequirementsSystem to work on Rails 3.2 (this looks like it isn't really used anyway)
- modified test for a valid active record connection

If all of that can be done then the changes are just:
- gem updates
- deep_cloning fixes
- rspec "theme unimplemented" extension fix
- remove rack_hotfix that it not needed anymore
- change Clonable to use dup instead of clone
- update features/support/env.rb
- switch cucumber steps to use "step" method instead of When, Then, or Given
- remove debug_rjs (not supported in rails 3.2)
