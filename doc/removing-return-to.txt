PasswordController

return_to is used by the password controller So when a user changes a password it can go back to the right place.
As far as I can tell this only matters in two places:
- an admin is on the user listing pages and hits the reset_password button
- an user is on their preference page and hits the change password button

In these cases if the cancel or submit button is pressed it should go back to the source page, but this page is
two pages back.

The password change route is referenced in several other places but in these cases returning to the root is ok.

A fix would be to pass the return_to as a parameter in the change_password url.


UsersController

return_to is set here on the index page to support:
- the PasswordController documented above

the confirm route used to use redirect_to but is was only used the activation button
so a simple redirect_back_or_root seemed fine
the email sent out to uses uses the users/confirmation which is provided by devise

CustomFailure

The store_location! used in CustomFailure is not related to return_to:
