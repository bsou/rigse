Description:
    Generate a page_element
    
    Pass the name of the page element (in singular form), either CamelCased or
    under_scored, as the first argument, and an optional list of attribute
    pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. 
    
    Several default attributes are setup for you:
        
        id:
        name:
        description:
        uuid:
        created_at:datetime 
        updated_at:datetime
        teacher_note:


    You don't have to think up every attribute up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the resource immediately.

    For example, 'element DrawTool background_image:string popup:boolean'
    gives you a model with those attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

    If you want to remove all the generated files, run
    'script/destroy element DrawTool'.

Examples:
    `./script/generate element DrawTool`
    `./script/generate element DrawTool background_image:string popup:boolean`
    `./script/generate element DrawTool`
