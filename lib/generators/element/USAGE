Description:
    Stubs out a new PageElement sublcass. 
    Pass the model name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'. Other
    pre-created attributes are:
      name
      description
      teacher_notes
      uuid
      user
      

    This generates a PageElement class in app/models,  a migration in
    db/migrate, a controller in app/controllers, some routes, and lots
    of views and partials in views/page_elements/
    

Examples:
    `./script/generate element xhtml content:text`
        creates a new page element with a attribute named content (text)
        
        It creates these files:
            Model:      app/models/xhtml.rb
            Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_xhtml.rb
            Controller: app/controllers/htmls_controller.rb
            Views:      app/views/xhtmls/_xhtml.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/_show.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/_remote_form.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/destroy.js.rjs
                        app/views/xhtmls/edit.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/index.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/show.html.haml
                        app/views/xhtmls/new.html.haml
